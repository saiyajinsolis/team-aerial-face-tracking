Face Tracking Feature

Not yet live tested on drone.

Next stages in development will involve the use of custome cascades in its tracking feature.

Ideas include the possibilty of having it behave differently depending on the kind of object it detects.

Credits to Murtaza's Workshop Drone Computer Vision tutorial in development of this code.

Further improvements and applications by me will come in the form of altering the behavior of the drone
based on what kind of object it detects.
